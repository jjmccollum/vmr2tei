    Attributes:
        id: The ID string of this reading, which should be unique within its parent app element.
        type: A string representing the type of reading. Examples include "reconstructed", "defective", "orthographic", "subreading", "ambiguous", "overlap", and "lac".
        text: Serialization of the contents of this element.
        wits: A list of sigla referring to witnesses that support this reading.
        targets: A list of other reading ID strings to which this reading corresponds. For substantive readings, this should be empty. For ambiguous readings, it should contain references to the readings that might correspond to this one. For overlap readings, it should contain a reference to the reading from the overlapping variation unit responsible for the overlap.
